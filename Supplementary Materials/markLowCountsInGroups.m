function mark2remove = markLowCountsInGroups(datain, cutoff, percent, groups)
% Description:
%   Purpose: To identify the features that do not reach a threshold value
%   in a given % of samples under investigation, segregated by sample
%   grouping
%   INPUT:
%        datain - a 2D martix of type double  where each column is a sample and each row is a feature
%        cutoff - an integer value to indicate quartile level to establish threshold value
%        percent - percent of samples that must pass the threshold
%        groups - sample labeling
%   OUTPUT:
%       mark2remove - a boolean vector indicating which features are marked to be below the threshold.
